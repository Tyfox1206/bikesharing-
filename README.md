## Purpose
The purpose of this weekâ€™s module was to demonstrate proficiency in using Tableau. To this we I took a CSV file from CitiBike and preformed analysis on it to show this system could be used in another city. Throughout the module I completed multiple visualizations to make understanding the data simple and clear.
 
Here is a link to the story I created on Tableau Public [link to Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tyler.fox6213/viz/NYCCitiBikeChallenge_16632776392790/CitiBikeChallengeStory?publish=yes)

## Results
Below are 8 visualizations I created with the data from CitiBike.
