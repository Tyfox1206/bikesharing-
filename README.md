## Purpose
The purpose of this weekâ€™s module was to demonstrate proficiency in using Tableau. To this we I took a CSV file from CitiBike and preformed analysis on it to show this system could be used in another city. Throughout the module I completed multiple visualizations to make understanding the data simple and clear.
 
Here is a link to the story I created on Tableau Public [link to Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tyler.fox6213/viz/NYCCitiBikeChallenge_16632776392790/CitiBikeChallengeStory?publish=yes)

## Results
Below are 8 visualizations I created with the data from CitiBike.

## Summary

Overall, we can that there are a lot of individuals use CitiBike in NYC. Most of which are in the main central area of the city. As well we can see that everyone uses these bikes not just residents. Another visualization that could be created is a map that show the most popular starting and stopping locations to see if bikes are being returned at the locations they got picked up at or if there being moved to another location. As well, another visualization could be to do a comparison to age and gender to see what demographic of user is using the bike the most.
